## Project Overview
### Research Problem:
People in Sri Lanka are polluting the environment due to a lack of environmental awareness and discipline, often stemming from a lack of education in their formative years.

### Project Purpose:
To address this issue, we aim to develop an ICT solution to educate school students (Grades 6-13) about waste management and sustainable practices. By fostering environmental consciousness from a young age, we hope to cultivate a generation of responsible citizens who contribute to a cleaner and greener Sri Lanka.
