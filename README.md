## Project Overview
### Research Problem:
People in Sri Lanka are polluting the environment due to a lack of environmental awareness and discipline, often stemming from a lack of education in their formative years.

### Project Purpose:
To address this issue, we aim to develop an ICT solution to educate school students (Grades 6-13) about waste management and sustainable practices. By fostering environmental consciousness from a young age, we hope to cultivate a generation of responsible citizens who contribute to a cleaner and greener Sri Lanka.

## Project Components
Our project comprises four key components:

1. Virtual Reality Tours
2. Waste Management Learning Hub
3. Event Management Platform
4. Creative Platform


## Tools and Technologies

The following tools and technologies will be employed in the development of the web application:

Front-end Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
Back-end Development: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Virtual Reality Development: 
AI and Machine Learning: TensorFlow, PyTorch
Version Control: Git

## Methodology
The research methodology primarily relied on a comprehensive literature review to identify the challenges and opportunities in waste management, particularly in the context of Sri Lanka. Data was collected from various online sources, including government websites, academic databases, and news articles. This data was analyzed to gain insights into the current state of waste management practices and to identify potential areas for improvement. By combining theoretical knowledge with empirical data, the research team was able to formulate the project objectives and design the ICT solution accordingly.
